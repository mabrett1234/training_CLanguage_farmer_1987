# Notes
- Obviously quite old, so taking suggestions lightly.
- Assumes input and output from terminal, or read/write to files.
- There were issues with permissions for read/writing of files.
  - I addressed this by changing the CLion working directory.
  - Also added path as an exception for Windows Defender.
  - The following Stack Overflow pages helped with troubleshooting:
    - [fopen not working in c](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7370892/fopen-not-working-in-c)
    - [how to read a file in clion in c programming](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76223797/how-to-read-a-file-in-clion-in-c-programming)
- While the IDE did some auto-formatting, I plan on overhauling based on this style guide:
